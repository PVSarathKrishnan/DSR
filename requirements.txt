# DSR Commit Logger - Python Dependencies

# GUI Framework (Optional - for beautiful single dialog)
# Install with: pip install -r requirements.txt
PyQt5>=5.15.0

# Alternative if PyQt5 doesn't work:
# PySide6>=6.0.0

# Note: The hook works without these (falls back to AppleScript/terminal mode)
# But PyQt5 gives you a beautiful single dialog with all fields
